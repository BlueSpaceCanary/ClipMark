I like the additions! It indeed answered my question. :)

Your evaluation is on point. As you mentioned, all that's left is the semantics. 
I like the use of testing throughout writing your DSL. This is definitely one place I am lacking in.

As I hold you to be a master of Scala, I wanted to see any cool tricks you did. I see the use of the '<~' and '~>' operators which is quite nifty.
Also, your code looks very presentable. Good comments, good documentation. I look forward to seeing the semantics in action!

No questions from me this week, I think everything is on track!
