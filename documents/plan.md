# Project plan

I don't feel comfortable trying to lay this out as a strict timeline
until I have a better sense of the complexity of the implementation
complexity. There's just too many variables to lay out a reasonable
timeline. I can, however, lay out the order of things I will do
including stretch goals in my best *effort* to judge weekly
deliverables, and update once I start coding with a more definite
timeline.

## Language evaluation

The language parses things into tags, then convert to formatted
text. It will keep a bank of tagged characters, locations, and scenes
along with their relations to each other as it parses, append the
information generated by these to the formatted text, and then do a
second-pass on the output text to add inline links to these appendices
where appropriate. So the evaluation of design is just how well I can
specify these features. The implementation evaluation will just be how
well the output actually works.

## Implementation plan

1. Set up basic calls into a library for the parent language to
   generate ordinary {html,TeX,whatever}.
2. Write the parser (should be pretty simple, it's just a few more
   tags in a markdown)
3. Write the mechanism for banking characters, scenes, locations, etc
4. Write a first-pass appendix generator
5. Write a second-pass appendix generator and generate in-text links.
6. (Stretch) Write graph-generation for visualization.

My best guess is that these will be relatively doable weekly
deliverables, but it's hard to commit to that before I start the code
and get a better sense of its complexity.
